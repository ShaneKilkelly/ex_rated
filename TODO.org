* Todo List

** Tasks

*** TODO Figure out how to separate storage from logic
- remove things like `ets_table_name` from state
  - move to storage backend
- open_table() call in init
  - generically, init storage backend
- checking rate

** Thoughts

Actually, once the backend is moved to another process, there's no reason for the
main ExRated api to be a process/application, as it caries no state.

So, the ExRated module can just be logic which points to the process which actually
manages the state.



** API Points

- init
- count_hit
  - bucket_exists?
  - increment_bucket
- inspect_bucket
- delete_bucket
- prune_expired_buckets
